Smart Voting Through Facial Recognition

Introducing the latest smart voting project that incorporates advanced face recognition technology to ensure a safe and secure voting experience. With this system, voters will be required to register their details, including their image, in a database during registration.

During the voting process, the voter's image will be matched with the one in the database to ensure authenticity. In addition to this, an OTP verification process will also be conducted to verify the voter's identity.

This system guarantees that only registered voters will be allowed to vote, preventing any fraudulent activities such as double voting or impersonation. The use of face recognition technology and OTP verification process ensures that the voting process is tamper-proof and foolproof.

With this system, voters can have confidence in the voting process, knowing that their vote will count and that the election results will be accurate. This is a significant step forward in ensuring that every vote counts and that democracy remains strong.
